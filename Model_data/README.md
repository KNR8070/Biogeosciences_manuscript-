## Details of the data

This data contains the CLM5 model out of the following experiments
  1. CTRL - control simulation
  2. S_Clim - simulation which used 1901-1920 climate data as input
  3. S_CO2 - simulation which used a pre-industrial CO2 data for driving the model
  4. S_NFert - simulation in which nitrigen fertilisers were not applied to crops
  5. S_Irrigation - simulation in which irrigation was not applied to the crops

 This directory also has the observational data of crop parameters (LAI, yield, and Dry Matter) and also carbon fluxes data (extracted from published material)
